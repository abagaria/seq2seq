In your README, please note down:

- A brief description talking about your rationale behind the 
  hyperparameters used,
- Your perplexity and accuracy scores for both the BPE-preprocessed 
  dataset, and the standard dataset,
- A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using byte-pair 
  encoding over traditional methods.

If you have tried experimenting with hyperparameters, please note down:

- What hyperparameter experiments you have tried,
- For each experiment, what the results were,
- A brief discussion comparing and contrasting the results between the
  experiments, and why the results were the way they were.

Even if you were not able to achieve good results with any of the models
developed, if you provide a substantial report describing multiple experiments,
rationale behind why the experiments were attempted and why they did/didn't
work, and discussion on why some worked better than others, etc. you will be
able to receive substantial partial credit.
